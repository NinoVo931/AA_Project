    "Future demand is a key factor that will steer operational decision making of a shared rental network. As a data scientist it is your responsibility to facilitate this type of decision support. For the purpose of this assignment we will be interested in forecasting total system-level demand in the next hour. To do so, develop a prediction model that predicts bike rental demand as a function of suitable features available in or derived from the datasets (incl. the weather data).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Feature Engineering: Develop a rich set of features that you expect to be correlated with your target. In this process you can draw on your domain knowledge and/or conduct additional research around the topic of demand prediction in vehicle rental networks. Justify your selection of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model Building: Select three regression algorithms that are suitable for the prediction task at hand. Explain and justify why you selected the three algorithms and describe their respective advantages and drawbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Evaluation: How well do the models perform? Evaluate and benchmark your models’ performance using suitable evaluation metrics. Which model would you select for deployment?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Outlook: How could the selected model be improved further? Explain some of the improvement levers that you might focus on in a follow-up project."
